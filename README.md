Case study for Collective Intelligence Assembly for Innovation Policy blog
==============================

Code for data collection, analysis and visualisation of data about R&D in AI.

Project activities
-------------

1. Collect data from Arxiv API using research categories + relevant search strings (e.g. machine+learning, artificial+intelligence etc)
2. Analyse historical activity vs baseline
3. Topic modelling / analysis of trends
4. Identify and analyse policy-related issues manually or through some other method
5. Obtain researcher affiliations (e.g via Microsoft Academic Knowledge API)
6. Geocode researcher affiliations (e.g. via Open Street Map API)
7. Map geography of AI research and its evolution (including vignettes on policy-relevant issues)
8. Map networks and their evolution (including vignettes on policy relevant issues)
